# DESCRIPTION
#	The purpose of configure is to setup Bash shell variables to be used to build a
#	project.
#
# OBJECTIVES
#	1. configure should centrallize all variables need to be change to build a new version
#		of this project (we are not able to achieve tis yet)
#	2. configure should specify variables that are used in Makefile, Bash script or Perl script
#		so that values used in these scripts will always be consistent
#	3. configure should make build parameters explicit so it is easy to understand and change.
#	4. configure does not set shell variables directly. Instead, it generates a build.config
#		script that can be sourced to set shell variables (i.e., source build.config). The
#		goal is make it easy to override any setting temporary by editing build.config.
#	5. In case of automated build error, you can fix an error and rebuild and be certain that
#		the result will be the same as automated build. Since automated build will left behind
#		a build.config file. All you need to do is the following and the code will be compiled
#		with the right compile flags, binaries stamped with correct version and build #s.
#			a) Go to root directory of a build tree
#			b) Run "source setEnv"
#			c) Run "source build.config"
#			d) Go to a directory that needs to be rebuild
#			e) Run "make $MAKE_CFLAGS_32
#
#
# USAGE
#	This script must be run from the root of a source tree where this script is located. It
#	must be run after sourcing setEnv. Also, if it is run manually with --type=release from 
#	a Bash shell, you need to specify BUILD_NUMBER which is normally supplied by Hudson.
#		export BUILD_NUMBER=10001
#
#	configure supports remapping the root directory to a drive letter. This must be done in
#	concert with a change in setEnv to map a drive. In addition, the drive must not be used
#	by another project on the same machine at the same time. Otherwise, two build project
#	will interfere with each other and result in strange build errors. The only time you may
#	want to remap build root to a drive letter is because a path is longer than 256 characters.
#	When a path is too long, InstallShield or Cygwin may fail with strange error.
#
#	See printUsage() for more details.
#
# NOTES
#	Hudson specific
#		1. When bash script is run from Hudson, the output string of $(hostname), $(whoami) 
#			is return with a trailing '\r'. Use tr to remove the trailing '\r' 
#			($(hostname | tr -d "\r")).
#
#	No PCV option
#		1. Custom project are normally simple. The is no point in creating PCV build. Also, 
#			we do not maintain a mainline branch for such project in Perforce. We work on 
#			a release branch directly. That also makes it easier to locate changelist for 
#			each revision.
#
#	Two types of custom projects
#		1. Generic
#			This type of projects are delivered to more than one customer. They are found
#			in Perforce under //depot/ProfessionalServices/<project-name>/<revision>
#			(e.g., S:\build\custom\StripAttachment\5.2.0.0\3\StripAttachment-32-5.2.0.0-3-Tyco-base-oe5.5.6-20110912.zip).
#		2. Customer specific
#			This type of projects is tailored to a specific custom's environment and will
#			not be deployed by another customer. They can be found in Perforce under
#			//depot/ProfessionalServices/<customer>/<project-name>/<revision>
#			(e.g., S:\build\custom\KLA\EncryptionCreate\1.0.0.0\1).
#
#	xlib content
#		1. Use of xlib is slightly different between a custom project and a product project.
#			Custom xlib contains both external dependencies required to build a project as
#			well as dependencies required to build an install package (normally a zip file).
#			Doing so allow a custom project to be rebuilt easily by backing up a xlib during
#			the publishing phrase.
#		2. xlib content should be published in the same directory as install package with
#			name such as StripAttachment-5.2.0.0-3-20110912-xlib.zip.
#
#	Publishing of a build
#		1. Custom project is typically published to S:/build/custom. 
#		2. If a project is generic, it should be published to 
#			S:/build/custom/<project-name>/<revision>/<build-#>. 
#		3. If a project is customer specific, it is published to
#			S:/build/custom/<customer>/<project-name>/<revision>/<build-#>.
#		4. The install package of a build is published as a zip file. Since there are a large
#			variety of custom projects and sometimes multiple custom projects are delivered
#			in one installer, installer is generally build separately. For example, you may 
#			find s:/build/custom/Tyco/ClientObligations/2.0.0.0/11 contains scripts to build an
#			installer that groups StripAttachment, ZipTagging and SAPTagging of various 
#			versions.
#		5. Typically the followings are published at the end of a build:
#			- Install package
#				<project-name>-<arch>-<version>-<build-#>-<customer>-<special-feature>-<date>.zip
#				(e.g., StripAttachment-32-5.2.0.0-3-Tyco-base-oe5.5.6-20110912.zip)
#			- Binaries with debug symbol files
#				<project-name>-<arch>-<version>-<build-#>-<customer>-<special-feature>-bin-<date>.zip
#				(e.g., StripAttachment-5.2.0.0-3-20110912-bin.zip).
#			- xlib files that can be used to rebuild and repackage this project
#				<project-name>-<arch>-<version>-<build-#>-<customer>-<special-feature>-xlib-<date>.zip
#				(e.g., StripAttachment-5.2.0.0-3-20110912-xlib.zip).

# Configurable build properties
#
# Description:
#	The properties in this file are configurable properties. They should be updated 
#	according to the environment and release version. The properties should are used
#	by build_xlib.xml, build_compile.xml and build_publish.xml. This property file
#	should contain all the properties to run any of these Ant scripts. If any 
#	configurable property is missing, it should be added to this script.
#
#	Note that this script should not contain any property that acts a local variable
#	to a build.xml file. Those should be specified in the build.xml file using
#	<properties> tag.
#
#	For developer:
#		The values specified in this property file need to be adjusted in order for 
#		you to compile code in you development environment using build_compile.xml. 
#		Since this property file contains all configurable properties needed to
#		build a source tree, you should be able to build after updating this file.
#		You may compile using compileIt.bat or run Ant at a command prompt.
#
#	For build machine:
#		To perform scripted build, we may generate this build.properties file
#		on-the-fly or use Ant commandline to override the properties. Ant commandline
#		can be specified through environment varibale ANT_ARGS. In either case, specify
#		-D<name>=<value> to override a property.
